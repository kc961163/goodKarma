## Overview

**Good Karma** is a social networking application designed to encourage individuals to develop healthy habits and contribute positively to society. Users are motivated to share their daily good deeds—such as journaling, meditation, yoga, donating, and volunteering—by creating posts that document their activities. 

Each post, which can include text and images, helps users accumulate karma points that reflect their contributions. These karma points are then displayed on personal profiles and are used to rank users on a community leaderboard, fostering a spirit of friendly competition and personal growth.
