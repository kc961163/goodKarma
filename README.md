## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MySQL database (for local development)

## Database Configuration Options

### Option 1: Local Development with MySQL

1. Create or update your `.env.local` file in the `api` directory:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/goodkarma"
   JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret-key"
   RAPID_API_KEY="your-rapid-api-key"
   RAPID_API_HOST="ai-life-coach-api-personal-development-online-coaching.p.rapidapi.com"
   ```

2. Ensure your `schema.prisma` file is configured for MySQL:
   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "mysql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

3. Run migrations for your MySQL database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

4. To use this configuration, copy it to your active `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local .env
   ```

### Option 2: Deployment with PostgreSQL on Render

1. Create or update your `.env` file for Render deployment:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@postgres.render.com:5432/goodkarma"
   JWT_SECRET="your-production-secret-key"
   RAPID_API_KEY="your-rapid-api-key"
   RAPID_API_HOST="ai-life-coach-api-personal-development-online-coaching.p.rapidapi.com"
   PORT="10000"  # Render will set this automatically
   ```

2. Modify your `schema.prisma` file for PostgreSQL:
   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
     relationMode = "prisma"
   }
   ```

3. Update your `package.json` to include Render-specific scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node index.js",
     "preinstall": "npm i -D prisma",
     "postinstall": "npx prisma db push"
   }
   ```

4. For local testing of the PostgreSQL setup, you can create a backup of your current environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env .env.current && cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Switching Between Environments

To switch between MySQL (local) and PostgreSQL (Render):

1. **For local MySQL development**:
   - Make sure your `.env` file contains MySQL configuration: `cp .env.local .env`
   - Ensure `schema.prisma` has `provider = "mysql"`
   - Use `npx prisma migrate dev` for schema changes

2. **For PostgreSQL Render preparation**:
   - Update your `.env` file with PostgreSQL configuration
   - Change `schema.prisma` to use `provider = "postgresql"`
   - Use `npx prisma db push` instead of migrations

### Setting Up the Backend

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/goodkarma.git
   cd goodkarma
   ```

2. Install API dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   ```

3. Choose your database configuration option (MySQL or PostgreSQL) and set up the appropriate `.env` file.

4. Run the database setup (migrations for MySQL, push for PostgreSQL):
   ```bash
   # For MySQL
   npx prisma migrate dev
   
   # For PostgreSQL
   npx prisma db push
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```

2. Install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
   REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY="your-rapid-api-key"
   REACT_APP_RAPID_API_HOST="ai-life-coach-api-personal-development-online-coaching.p.rapidapi.com"
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000

## External API Integration

GoodKarma integrates with the AI Life Coach API to provide personalized coaching features.

### API Features

- **Personalized Advice:** Generates tailored guidance based on user's activities
- **Goal Analysis:** Helps identify and track personal growth goals
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitors achievements and setbacks over time
- **Action Planning:** Creates customized action plans based on user preferences

### API Quota Management

To manage API usage limits:

- Each user is limited to one coaching advice call per month
- Each user is limited to one progress update call per month
- API usage is tracked in the database with automatic monthly resets
- Clear UI indicators show users their current quota status

## Running Tests

GoodKarma uses Jest and React Testing Library for frontend testing.

### Running Frontend Tests

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Deployment

### Preparing for Deployment

1. Update your API's index.js to use environment variables for PORT:
   ```javascript
   const PORT = parseInt(process.env.PORT) || 8000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT} ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€`);
   });
   ```

2. Update your Prisma schema for production database:
   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }
   
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql" // Change to postgresql for Render
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
     relationMode = "prisma"
   }
   ```

3. Update package.json scripts in the API folder:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node index.js",
     "preinstall": "npm i -D prisma",
     "postinstall": "npx prisma db push"
   }
   ```

### Deploying to Render

1. Create a PostgreSQL database on Render
2. Create a Web Service on Render pointing to your repo
3. Set the root directory to `api`
4. Set build command: `npm install`
5. Set start command: `npm start`
6. Configure environment variables in Render dashboard using your `.env` values

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
2. Navigate to client directory: `cd client`
3. Run: `vercel`
4. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
